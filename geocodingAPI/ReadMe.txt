Steps to run code:
1.Make sure you have the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt installed. (create venv if necessary)
2.Put both python files in same directory (api.py is the main driver code, parts.py implements the required functions). Open terminal and cd into that directory.
3.run the following command -->  python api.py
This brings up the server and can be accessed by 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/getAddressDetails'
4.Send POST request to the above address using any API testing tool with the appropriate JSON body. The appropriate response will be received.
5.When done using use ctrl+C in terminal to shutdown server.
